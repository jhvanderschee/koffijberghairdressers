Hairdressing is part of my DNA. So much that my passion for the profession has become a way of life. For me, the most important thing is that the client leaves the salon satisfied: a smile is the prettiest thing you can wear. This is what I want to contribute to. My other passion is to teach young people all about the hairdressing profession. This is why I worked in education for a year. Yet, in the end, I am more a hairdresser than a teacher. At Koffijberg, as education manager and hairdresser, I'll be able to combine both my passions.
