Amsterdam, April 2016 – This year, Koffijberg celebrates its 40th anniversary. This inspired Kimm to launch one, comprehensive ‘Tribute Collection 2016’, rather than two separate collections. The first part of the collection is released in Spring, the second part in Fall. [WATCH THE MOVIE "40 YEARS KOFFIJBERG"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRKbYh74pRY)

The Tribute Collection honors ‘Forty years of Koffijberg’. The most iconic looks created by Kimm and Richard Koffijberg over the past decades have been translated into beautiful and wearable hairstyles anno 2016. Richard and Kimm were inspired and trained following the principles of Vidal Sassoon, the founder of contemporary hair cutting techniques. Kimm’s current collection resembles the past collections in its consistent focus on the hair (rather than the ‘noise’ surrounding it), on constant innovation, and wearable styles. High technical standards, craftsmanship, and constant innovation are the roots Kimm builds on, both in this Tribute Collection and as a modern trendsetter. 

In addition, the collection refers to the ‘I-dentity’ concept, which Kimm recently developed and which takes hair color, hairstyle, and makeup advice to the next level. I-dentity goes beyond facial shape or skin color, and even beyond the latest trends. According to Kimm, hairstyle and makeup need to broadly emphasize your identity and lifestyle. “What do you need?”, “what do you want say with your look?”, “what do you want to show?”

## Then

In the 70s, much was invested in technique. The 80s were all about punk. Punk haircuts were stylish. This is clearly shown in this hairstyle. It is all about craftsmanship, attention to structure, texture, and softness. 

## Now

Close attention was paid to what precisely suits the model, in terms of hair color, division of volume, and look. To emphasize her facial shape, the sides of the hair have been cut short but still cover the scalp, while the upper layers have been kept rather long. If you were to leave the sides longer, this would make her face look too broad. The accent is placed on top. By slicing the hair, a soft structure is created. As this perfectly matches her facial color, various grey tones have been used. Kimm continues the deeper, darker colors in the lengths of the hair to create low-lights. For the styling, use was made of a round brush to create volume and a slight waive in the hair. Finally, Kimm models the hair using her hands.

## Then

This hairstyle takes its inspiration from the 70s (Farrah Fawcett), but is also very wearable. For the hair, only one base color is used.

## Now

Starting from the model’s squared facial shape, volume has been created in the lower parts of the hair to avoid her face becoming either too broad or too long. By cutting layers into the hair, the hair gets more volume and looks soft. The model’s natural hair color is rather dark, risking a ‘tough’ look. Kimm plays with color (painting and balayage techniques) to highlight the model’s strong points. She uses a base color and applies a shade of blond around the face. As a result, a soft look is created. Towards the back, the hair has been kept rather dark, as the model does not want to visit the hairdresser too often. Like this, the color grows out naturally. By curling the hair, you become more aware of the color separation in the hair. This creates contrast. If you want a flowing movement, you simply brush the hair more extensively.

## Then

In dit kapsel herken je de ambachtelijkheid. Er is gewerkt met harde en zachte lijnen en het haar is op verschillende manieren te stylen: kort/lang.With this hairstyle, you recognize craftsmanship. Strong and soft lines have been combined and the hair can be styled in different ways: short/long. 

## Now

Also today, Kimm uses both strong and soft lines. This model’s facial shape has been optically made slimmer by creating volume on the upper sides. The emphasis is placed just above the cheekbones, because this is where her face is broadest. By slicing the hair, you create airiness in the upper layers. Cool, dark shades suit her facial color best. Around her face, the hair color has been kept quite cool. In the more massive upper layers of the hair, soft/warm tints have been applied, to create a softer look. On the picture where the model wears the hair behind her ear, she keeps a feminine appearance. Because the way in which the color is applied on the upper parts of the hair, a ‘helmet-effect’ is avoided. On the other picture, the hair has been styled manually, using a Sea salt product. The focus is on length and airiness.

## Then

This so-called ‘Bob hairstyle’ is very graphic, with its round facial shapes. The coloring technique is squared. Everything says contrast. Back then people said: the model has a soft face, so the hard lines are okay.

## Now

The model has a strong and rectangular face. By cutting her fringe a bit shorter and by using round cutting lines, you shorten the forehead and make her face look more oval shaped. With a wet-look, the round shapes disappear, but by applying structure, a soft appearance is maintained.
Because of the strong lines in this hairstyle, a color was chosen that is not overly cool. If you would opt for a cool tone, the model would come across as cold. Contrast is created by combining a soft/warm hair color with strong lines. The hair has been blow-dried straight using a round brush, rolling the end of the layers inward in order to create a rounded shape. 

## The I-dentity concept

The volume, shape, color, and condition of your hair say a lot about who you are and what you want to show. Through your hairstyle, you reveal part of your identity. Beautiful hair strengthens you inside out. It has been shown that there is a direct relationship between your sense of self-worth and (responses of others to) your hairstyle.

This is why Kimm Koffijberg developed I-dentity: Comprehensive advice about a new hair color, a hairstyle, and complementing makeup. I-dentity goes beyond facial shape or skin color, and even beyond the latest trends. According to Kimm, hairstyle and makeup need to broadly emphasize your identity and lifestyle. I-dentity consists of three core components: Style I-dentity (advice about hairstyle and styling), Color I-dentity (hair color analysis) and makeup.

Characteristic of I-dentity is the elaborate interaction between the client and a trained stylist. Tools like a survey, mood boards, and color collars facilitate the conversation and ensure that client and hairdresser understand each other perfectly. Looks, wishes, strong and weak points, and overall lifestyle are discussed extensively – as well as the reason for wanting change. Based on all information and his or her own impressions, the professional arrives at a highly personalized I-dentity recommendation, intended as an encouragement and support for the client to make a personal statement: Creating the opportunity for the client to become her most self-confident and beautiful self.
