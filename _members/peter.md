To be happy with your new self! That is what I'd like to achieve, together with you. Your hair strengthens your character. It shows the outside world who you are and what you stand for. It forms part of your signature style, which helps you grow in your work and in your daily life. I'd like to further develop this with you. Inspired by fashion and trends, but also having an eye for the individual person, I started in the hairdressing industry. Using the knowledge I gained over the last years, I developed international trendlines for various hairdressing brands. Education always came first. By never ceasing to learn about the latest trends and by sharing our knowledge, we do not only improve our team and the industry, but we also make our clients look even more beautiful.&nbsp;
