Boëlle started her career as a junior stylist at Koffijberg and is really trained in the "Koffijberg" way. Due to her curiosity and unprecedented motivation, she accepted everything that was presented to her and quickly developed in her field. She has been a successful stylist for some time now. She is now the expert in the field of high lights. She is a perfectionist and therefore works very precisely and refined. She likes a nice chat but also offers a good listening ear. Her calm and empathetic character quickly makes you feel comfortable with Boëlle in the chair. She is very creative with hair and can blow-dry beautifully.
