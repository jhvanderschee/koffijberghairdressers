Bo joined team Koffijberg as a junior stylist at a young age and started her career. Because of her enormous drive and eagerness to learn, Bo has rapidly developed into a master stylist and color specialist. This is due to her love for the profession, but also because of her love for dealing with people. Her levelheaded view allows her to empathize with the person sitting in her chair. In her advice she looks at what you as a customer needs in terms of a haircut or hair color. Coaching her customers in the personal plans 'Shining Gray' and 'Color Identity' is therefore perfect for her. With her fresh look at hair trends, she also creates beautiful trend stories on our social media channels.
