title: 'WASH & CUT (45 MIN.)'
---

**Before our hairdressers cut your hair, in our salon you get an enjoyable hair wash and scalp massage. Meanwhile you can relax on one of our salon chairs, which are equipped with two Shiatsu massage functions. We check the condition of your hair and scalp and you will receive personalized advice about a shampoo and/or a mask. In our salon we work with the brands Keune and K&eacute;rastase. After the massage wash, the hairdresser will cut your hair based on your personal preferences and his or her professional insights. Our hairdressers take the time to carefully listen to your wishes.
