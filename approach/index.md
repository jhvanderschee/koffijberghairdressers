For over 40 years, our trendsetting approach stands for craftsmanship, creativity, and innovation in haircuts, colors, and styling. Our hairdressers excel in their technical skills and dedicated approach to their clients.

## Personal attention

Our hairdressers want to know more about who you are and about your way of life. If youâ€™d like, they will take the time to discover which hairstyle, hair color, and styling suits your lifestyle best. We want you to enjoy a hairstyle that is both long-lasting and easy to maintain at home.

## Professional and trendsetting

Each week, our hairdressers participate in a practice-oriented, in-house training session. In addition, we invite leading experts in the field to teach our hairdressers the tricks of the trade. We also regularly provide our hairdressers with communication skills training. We believe that good communication is essential when aiming to achieve excellent results.

To make sure that nothing goes unnoticed, we regularly invite a mystery guest to test our service and to assess our quality levels. We also ask our clients for feedback.

Kimm regularly gives trainings, both on a national and international level. Twice per year, she develops a unique collection for Koffijberg Hairdressers, in which she uses the most recent coloring and cutting techniques. As a result, our hairdressers are always fully informed about the most recent hairdressing techniques, trends, and products.

## Price differentiation

Koffijberg Hairdressers uses price differentiation. This means that we apply different rates for the same treatment. We use price differentiation, because the wages in the hairdressing industry are largely determined by age and experience. Depending on who is helping you, a different rate applies.

All our employees are well trained and talented. By freely selecting a hairdresser of your own choice, you can also determine how much you are willing to pay. Of course, for all the hairdressers in our salon, quality comes first.
