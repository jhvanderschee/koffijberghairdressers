title: Coiffure Award Nomination
---


Keune Global Color Director, Kimm Koffijberg, knows color like no other. She’s been in the hair business for over 17 years, has her own luxury hair salon and is the winner of multiple awards. On top of that, she’s a masterful stage artist, working international shows and master classes for Keune, and she develops creative color concepts for the yearly Keune Trend Collections. Kimm is a constant source of inspiration to Keune’s International Academy Team, which she heads and trains. Suffice to say, Kimm not only talks the talk, she walks the walk. Kimm’s artistry, talent, technical skills and immense contributions to the craft of hair have not gone unnoticed this year by the Coiffure Awards. Once again, she’s been nominated for Hair Color Technician of the Year. For her entry, Kimm took inspiration from Pantone’s Colors of the Year: Rose Quartz and Serenity. In her color creation, pastel pinks and baby blues flow together organically and seamlessly. The result is a windswept, cotton-candy-colored, irresistibly soft hairstyle that feels utterly modern.

On Sunday May 1, the winners of the Coiffure Award 2016 will be announced.
