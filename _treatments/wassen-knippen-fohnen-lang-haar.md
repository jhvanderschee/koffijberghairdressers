title: 'WASH, CUT & BLOW-DRY LONG HAIR (90 MIN.)'
---

*In our salon, before the hairdresser cuts your hair, you get an enjoyable hair and scalp massage wash. Meanwhile you can relax on one of our salon chairs, which are equipped with two Shiatsu massage functions. We check the condition of your hair and scalp and you will receive personalized advice about a shampoo and/or a mask. After the massage wash, the hairdresser will cut your hair based on your wishes and his or her professional insights. Once your hair has been cut, we will style your hair with a blow-dryer and brush(es). We only use the best products. In our salon we work with the brands [<u>Keune</u>](http://www.keune.nl/) and [<u>K&eacute;rastase</u>](http://www.kerastase.nl/nl-nl/home). Our hairdressers take the time to carefully listen to your wishes.*
